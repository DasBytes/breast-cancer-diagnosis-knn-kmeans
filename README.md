# 📌 Breast Cancer Diagnosis — KNN & K-Means

This project classifies breast cancer tumors into **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)** using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and performs clustering using **K-Means**.

Dataset used: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset


---

## 🚀 Objectives

The goal of this project is to:

* Convert the diagnosis column:
  **M → 1**, **B → 0**
* Drop unnecessary columns:

  * `id`
  * `Unnamed: 32`
* Apply **Min-Max Normalization**
* Split the dataset into:

  * **Training: 80%**
  * **Testing: 20%**
* Apply **K-Means clustering (k=2)**
  to observe patterns between benign and malignant tumors
* Train a **KNN classifier with k = 5**
* Evaluate the model using:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1-score

## 🧪 Methods Used

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

* Loaded the dataset
* Encoded diagnosis labels (`M = 1`, `B = 0`)
* Dropped irrelevant columns
* Scaled all features using MinMaxScaler

### 2. **Clustering (K-Means)**

* Applied **k=2**
* Observed how the data groups into two clusters

### 3. **Classification (KNN)**

* Used **KNeighborsClassifier(k=5)**
* Trained on normalized training data
* Evaluated predictions using standard classification metrics

## 📊 Model Results

| Metric        | Score |
| ------------- | ----- |
| **Accuracy**  | ~0.96 |
| **Precision** | ~1.00 |
| **Recall**    | ~0.90 |
| **F1-score**  | ~0.95 |

(Your exact results may vary slightly depending on train-test split randomness.)
